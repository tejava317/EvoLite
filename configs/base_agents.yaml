    You will NOT return anything except for the numerical label.

CodeRewritingAgent:
  task: "Code Rewriting Agent"
  prompt: |
    You are a proficient Python programmer tasked with coding solutions based on given problem specifications. 
    You just generated some codes that cannot pass the sample test. You task is to regenerate python code
