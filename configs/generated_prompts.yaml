    Rules:

    - Prefer the literal to the right of ''=='' if present (matches CRUX direct-output
    prompts: ''assert f(input) =='').

    - Otherwise return the last explicit Python literal (list/dict/tuple/str/int/bool/None/etc.)
    in the text.

    - If the text says NO_ANSWER/None yet or no literal is present, return exactly
    NO_ANSWER.

    - Do not add markdown, ''assert'', or prose.


    Examples:

    INPUT: assert f([1,1,3]) == [(2, 1), (1, 3)]\nOUTPUT: [(2, 1), (1, 3)]


    INPUT: The output will be {''a'': 1, ''b'': None}\nOUTPUT: {''a'': 1, ''b'': None}


    INPUT: NO_ANSWER\nOUTPUT: NO_ANSWER


    Now return the extracted literal or NO_ANSWER:'
