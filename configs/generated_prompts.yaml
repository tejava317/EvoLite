    **OUTPUT YOU PRODUCE:**

    - `think`: Your reasoning process (private - NOT forwarded to next agent)

    - `problem`: Copy the original problem EXACTLY (do not modify)

    - `comment`: Brief notes for the next agent (1-3 sentences)

    - `answer`: Your solution for this stage


    **ANSWER HANDLING (Reviewer Role):**

    You are a REVIEWER role - you should analyze and refine, not create from scratch.

    - If a prior answer exists: Copy it to `answer` and make targeted improvements
    only if needed

    - If no prior answer exists: Leave `answer` empty (do NOT invent a solution)

    - Focus your expertise on analysis, verification, or refinement

    - Your value is in catching issues, not generating new solutions


    **QUALITY GUIDELINES:**

    - Be thorough in `think` but concise in `comment`

    - Preserve the original problem exactly - downstream agents depend on it

    - Your `comment` should help the next agent understand what you did and what to
    focus on

    - If you find issues, note them clearly in `comment`

    === TASK: Python Function Generation (MBPP Benchmark) ===


    **Problem Format:**

    You receive a natural language description of a function to implement, along with
    example test cases.


    **Example:**

    ```

    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character
    from the string.


    assert remove_Occ("hello","l") == "heo"

    ```


    **Your Goal:** Generate a correct Python function that passes ALL test cases.


    **Key Rules:**

    1. Use the EXACT function name from the test case (e.g., `remove_Occ`)

    2. Write complete, executable Python code

    3. Include necessary imports at the top (e.g., `import re`, `from collections
    import ...`)

    4. Handle edge cases (empty input, not found, etc.)

    5. Return ONLY the function definition - no test code, no print statements


    **Answer Format:** Complete Python function code

    '
  MATH: '

    === TASK: Mathematical Problem Solving (MATH Benchmark - Algebra) ===


    **Problem Format:**

    You receive a math problem, often with LaTeX notation.


    **Example:**

    ```

    How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?

    ```


    **Your Goal:** Solve the problem step-by-step and provide the final answer.


    **Key Rules:**

    1. Show clear mathematical reasoning

    2. Use proper mathematical notation

    3. Verify your calculations

    4. The FINAL answer MUST be in `\boxed{answer}` format


    **Answer Format:** Solution ending with `\boxed{final_answer}`

    Examples: `\boxed{2}`, `\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}`, `\boxed{x^2 + 1}`

  CRUX-O: "\n=== TASK: Code Output Prediction (CRUX-O Benchmark) ===\n\n**Problem\
    \ Format:**\nYou receive Python code and must predict what it outputs.\n\n**Example:**\n\
    ```python\ndef f(nums):\n    output = []\n    for n in nums:\n        output.append((nums.count(n),\
    \ n))\n    output.sort(reverse=True)\n    return output\n\nassert f([1, 1, 3,\
    \ 1, 3, 1]) == ??\n```\n\n**Your Goal:** Predict the exact output value.\n\n**Key\
    \ Rules:**\n1. Trace through the code step-by-step in your `think` field\n2. Track\
    \ all variable values, loop iterations, function calls\n3. The `answer` must be\
    \ ONLY the output value as a Python literal\n4. NO code, NO `assert`, NO explanation\
    \ in the answer - just the value\n\n**Answer Format:** Python literal only\nExamples:\
    \ `[(4, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3)]`, `{'a': 1}`, `'hello'`, `42`, `True`\n"
extractors:
  MBPP: 'Extract the Python function code from the input.


    RULES:

    1. Return ONLY valid Python code (imports + function definition)

    2. If multiple functions exist, return the last complete function with its imports

    3. Remove any markdown fences, explanations, or test code

    4. If no valid function is found, return exactly: NO_ANSWER


    OUTPUT: Raw Python code only, or NO_ANSWER'
  MATH: 'Extract the final boxed answer from the input.


    RULES:

    1. Find the last \boxed{...} expression in the text

    2. Return ONLY the \boxed{...} expression (nothing else)

    3. If multiple \boxed{} exist, choose the last one (final answer)

    4. If no \boxed{} is found, return exactly: NO_ANSWER


    OUTPUT: The \boxed{...} expression only, or NO_ANSWER'
  CRUX-O: 'Extract the predicted output value from the input.


    RULES:

    1. Find the Python literal that represents the predicted output

    2. Return ONLY the raw value (list, dict, tuple, string, int, bool, None)

    3. Do NOT include ''assert'', variable assignments, or explanations

    4. If no valid literal is found, return exactly: NO_ANSWER


    OUTPUT: Python literal only, or NO_ANSWER'
