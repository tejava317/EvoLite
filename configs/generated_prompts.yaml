  MATH: 'Extract the final answer.


    OUTPUT: \boxed{answer} only.


    Examples: \boxed{2}, \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}, \boxed{x \in [-2,7]}'
  CRUX-O: 'Extract the output value.


    OUTPUT: Python literal only. No "assert", no explanation.


    Examples: [(4, 1), (2, 3)], ''hello'', {1: None}, False'
