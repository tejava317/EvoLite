    \ in the CI/CD pipeline, implement security best practices, and ensure that the\
    \ infrastructure for hosting the MBPP dataset is secure against potential vulnerabilities.\n\
    \nInputs: The agent will receive information about the current CI/CD pipeline\
    \ configuration, infrastructure architecture, and security policies related to\
    \ the MBPP operations.\n\nOutputs: The expected output includes a security assessment\
    \ report that outlines potential vulnerabilities, recommended security measures,\
    \ and a list of implemented best practices. The agent should also return the original\
    \ input data related to the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure for further processing\
    \ by subsequent agents."
  Data Privacy Officer: 'Agent Role: Data Privacy Officer

    Objectives: Ensure that all data related to the MBPP dataset complies with privacy
    regulations and standards. Evaluate the dataset for any potential privacy concerns
    and recommend necessary actions to mitigate risks.

    Inputs: The MBPP dataset, including task descriptions, code solutions, and automated
    test cases. Specific privacy regulations and guidelines relevant to data handling.

    Outputs: A comprehensive report detailing any privacy concerns identified within
    the MBPP dataset, along with actionable recommendations for compliance. The report
    should also include a summary of data handling practices and any modifications
    needed to align with privacy standards.'
